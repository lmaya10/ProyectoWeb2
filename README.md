# Requirements for running
First of all you must install yarn in your computer. In order to run the proyect locally, first you need to clone the proyect in your computer. After that, using the console you must open the folder of the project and use the command: yarn install. As well you must open the folder front and use the same command. 
This last must be done so that the dependencies of the project can be automatically installed. Later you must use the command yarn start in both of the folders (the global folder of the proyect and the front) so that both, the front-end and the back-end can  start tu run.
Now you must use the url: http://localhost:3001 for visualizing the webpage.
